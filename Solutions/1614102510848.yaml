label: Poor quality solder joints on GPU buck converter
description: >-
  Caused by bad design / bad manufacturing


  Reworked solder joints on U8900 -> fixed. This is a very common issue. Apple
  refurb/warrant program glues rubber to this chip to apply pressure against the
  case, but does not actually fix this problem.
